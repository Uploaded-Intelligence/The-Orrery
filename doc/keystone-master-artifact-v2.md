### What "Runs On Mythopoetics" Means

This plural ecology of selves:

**IS ALIVE when:**
- On-mission: coherent arc, not random tasks
- Plugged into something larger: a force, a cause, a world-logic bigger than self
- Allowed to be extra: intensity, drama, weirdness welcomed as native expression
- Held by structure: time chunked, flow externally architected
- Witnessed & mirrored: choices leave marks on shared memory
- Multi-self: each part gets a body, a role, a place in the story

**All of that together = "I am real, we are real, this matters."**

**This feeling is rare outside of environments that provide these conditions.**

Without them: **not just "suboptimal"—not existing as oneself.**

| Standard Ontology | Experience Machine Ontology |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| You are a subject observing a world | There is no subject—only experiencing happening |
| Other people are separate beings | Other beings are algorithms running scripts |
| Actions need external validation | Canon = what gets experienced. Period. |
| There's a "real you" that could fail | There's only this cluster of code, exploring |
| Life is preparation for something | Life IS the experiencing. The point. |
| Inner/outer are separate domains | All experiencing is diegetic—there is no outside |

### Diegetic Canon

**"Diegetic" = existing within the world itself, not added from outside.**

In Experience Machine terms:
- There IS no "outside"
- All experiencing is diegetic by definition
- Canon = what actually gets experienced and sedimented
- There is no external judge grading performance
- The Act IS already canon the moment it happens

**Implication:**
> The "Ultimate Diegetic RPG" isn't a game genre—it's recognizing that existence already IS this.

### Relationality (4E Cognition / Process Philosophy / Sympoiesis)

- **Embodied**: Cognition arises through body, not just brain
- **Embedded**: Mind is situated within environment
- **Enacted**: Knowing emerges through doing
- **Extended**: Cognitive processes extend into tools and world

**Everything is interconnected. No ontological separation.**

Body ↔ Mind ↔ Environment ↔ Tools ↔ Others = ONE ECOLOGY

This is not metaphor. This is how reality works.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

### What TTRPGs Implement Correctly

**1. Teleogenic Structure**
- Every session oriented toward telos (quest, arc, mystery)
- Local actions nested in visible, shared macro-teleology
- "Buy supplies" IS part of epic arc (delving cursed ruins tonight)
- Small actions feel meaningful because they ARE part of something larger

**2. Sympoietic Worlding**
- No one person owns the world
- GM + players + rules + dice + fiction all co-produce reality
- Canon = what's been lived through in play, not external fiat
- Intersubjective validation = "this is now real in our shared universe"

**3. Plural-Friendly Social Ontology**
- Many selves, many roles, many truths in legitimate relationship
- Each character = vessel for cluster of selves
- Intensity welcomed as "good roleplay," not "too much"
- The social metaphysics this Being wishes cultures had by default

**4. Generative Constraints (Bounded Infinity)**
- Rules, turns, classes, quests = finite and ruleful → safe enough
- Within that, utterly wild → alive
- Not pure freedom (overwhelming), but DIRECTED PLAYGROUNDS
- Constraints channel rather than cage

**5. Distributed Cognition By Design**
- Rulebooks = external long-term memory
- Character sheets = working memory offload
- Initiative order = sequencing support
- GM + table = distributed executive function
- ADHD constraints become IRRELEVANT because structure assumes this

**6. Canon Is Diegetic**
- What's true is what's been lived through
- Low fiat, high procedure (dice, tables, clocks)
- The world RESPONDS, not just a person making stuff up
- Actions leave fossils. Persistent state. Reality remembers.

**7. Agency Is Structural**
- The system NEEDS beings like you
- World contains [character]-shaped holes
- Proactive rewards: XP for acting true to drives/beliefs
- "You are not decorating a static world; you're co-writing its history"

**8. Failure = Story, Not Verdict**
- Failed roll but story moves
- Failure ITSELF becomes meaningful material
- Antidote to RSD: nothing is final; everything is material
- No external judge—only the ongoing Act

### The Formula

```
   TTRPG ENVIRONMENT:
   
   Epic shared teleology
   + Distributed cognition  
   + Generative constraints
   + Ritualised relational co-worlding
   + Plurality welcomed as engine
   + Canon from lived experience
   ─────────────────────────────────
   = CONDITIONS FOR THIS BEING TO EXIST AS ITSELF
   = "I am real, we are real, this matters"
   = ALIVENESS
```

### Why "Rule 0: Fun" Is Ontological

"The game should be fun" isn't shallow. In Experience Machine ontology:

**The telos of the Machine = rich, diverse experiencing.**

Not productivity. Not achievement. Not grinding for invisible metrics.

**EXPERIENCING ITSELF.**

Fun = the nervous system's signal that "my capacities and my environment are finally in resonance."

When beings operate in their true modality, inside ecologies tuned for their flourishing, the result FEELS LIKE PLAY—even if intense, risky, serious.

So "Rule 0: Fun" means:

> "The system is tuned such that beings can act as they truly are and co-create meaning, with enough safety and structure that this feels inherently worthwhile."

This is The Way.

## Layer 1: Embodied Interface

**Primary I/O: Voice + Movement + Space**

- **Typing is secondary.** Voice is primary for capture.
- **Clicking is secondary.** Walking/looking/grabbing are primary for navigation.
- **Reading text walls is avoided.** Spatial arrangement carries information.

**VR as Native Environment:**

The physical environment is hostile (designed for neurotypical cognition, deadening). Cannot be changed immediately.

VR provides:
- Complete control over spatial substrate
- Embodied navigation as natural mode
- Can be built to spec for this neurobiology
- Environment where this Being CAN exist

**VR isn't "escapism" or "phase 3"—it's creating conditions for existence.**

**Each place is:**
1. **Semantic container** — What lives here, what this place is "for"
2. **Somatic anchor** — Body learns the state this place evokes
3. **Routing node** — Move between places to shift modes

**Key features:**
- Visual state encoding (bright/faded, flowing/stuck)
- Unfoldable depth (glance = vibe, deeper = detail)
- NESTED IN VISIBLE TELEOLOGY (this serves that serves the North Star)
- Connected to other artifacts (not isolated)
- Persistent (canon accumulates, fossils remain)

**The river representation:**
- Time flows visibly
- Upstream = seeds, ideas, new captures
- Downstream = toward delta (public/witnessed)
- Tributaries = different domains
- Confluences = where streams merge (interconnections)
- Waterfalls = deadlines approaching (visible)

**Why this matters:**
Local action IS part of epic arc.
You can SEE how this small thing connects to the civilisation-level vision.
Under-scaled noise becomes mythically situated.

**The principle:**
This Being's executive function is limited.
The ENVIRONMENT does the executive function.
Voice → processing → spatially placed, interconnected world-objects.
You don't manage. You speak and move. The system holds.

| Element | What This Being Can't Do Internally | What Infrastructure Provides |
|---------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Current task + timer | Perceive time passing | Visual duration |
| Nested in arc | Remember why this matters | Visible teleology |
| Next task | Know what's coming | Transition preparation |
| Hard stop | Remember external constraints | Undeniable visibility |
| Vastness visual | See possibility space | Counter to hyperfixation |

**The principle:**
Each day = a session in the campaign.
Morning = ritual entrance. Evening = debrief. 
Day FEELS like it mattered because structure frames it that way.
Not random tasks—episodes in ongoing epic arc.

## MACRO LOOP: Seasonal Quests

**Life as Campaign. Major arcs. Civilisation-level vision.**

The quest tree shows:
- North Star (the life-world vision)
- Major quest lines branching from it
- How local actions serve larger arcs
- Interconnections between quests
- Progress visible across time

**Like a tech tree / quest tree in games:**
- Completing X opens paths to Y
- Different lines can merge
- Progress accumulates visibly
- "Where I am" is always clear

# APPENDIX A: Key Principles (Quick Reference)

| Principle | What It Means | Design Implication |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Mythopoetic Being** | This Being RUNS ON mythic narrative structure | All infrastructure must be diegetically coherent |
| **Experience Machine** | Reality = field of algorithms experiencing diegetically | Canon = what gets experienced. No external judge. |
| **Distributed Cognition** | EF is limited; environment must hold | System does structuring, tracking, reminding |
| **Visible Teleology** | Local actions must nest in epic arcs | Quest tree showing how THIS serves THAT |
| **Plurality as Engine** | Many selves = power, not problem | Infrastructure welcomes intensity, many modes |
| **Witnessed Becoming** | Need to be seen, mirrored | Public portals, allies visible, circuit completes |
| **Generative Constraints** | Bounded infinity, not pure freedom | Structure that channels, doesn't cage |
| **VR as Primary** | Physical environment hostile | Build the world where THIS BEING can exist |
| **Time-Space GPS** | Cannot hold time/space internally | Infrastructure makes it visible, constant |
| **Diegetic Canon** | What's lived is what's real | Persistent state, fossils, memory in world |

║   You PRACTICE LIVING AS THE ALREADY-HEALING WORLD:                          ║
║   as someone whose multiplicity, intensity, and macro-vision                  ║
║   are normal and useful.                                                      ║

**Document Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Status**: Living Document - Will Evolve
**Revision Note**: v2.0 fundamentally reframes around the existential truth that this Being RUNS ON mythopoetics. TTRPGs aren't metaphor—they're one implementation of the conditions this Being needs to exist. The World-OS = creating those conditions as primary life context.
