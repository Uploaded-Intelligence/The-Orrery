# Recursive Systems Thinking Skills

A comprehensive skill suite designed to enhance agentic coding on complex projects through recursive systems thinking.

## The Philosophy

Complex systems cannot be understood through linear thinking alone. These skills embody recursive systems thinking - understanding how parts relate to wholes, how changes propagate, and how patterns repeat at different scales.

### The Three Scales (Mirroring The Orrery)

```
STRATEGIC (Macro)     → Architecture, phases, long-term direction
    ↕ feedback
TACTICAL (Micro)      → Specific changes, implementations, code
    ↕ feedback
VERIFICATION (GPS)    → Am I on track? Does this align? Is it working?
```

## The Skill Suite

### Master Orchestration

| Skill | Purpose | When to Invoke |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **recursive-systems-thinking** | Master cognitive framework | Starting significant work, feeling overwhelmed, architectural decisions |

### Foundational Skills

| Skill | Purpose | When to Invoke |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **deep-context-builder** | Build mental models before action | Starting tasks, entering unfamiliar code, something unexpected |
| **change-impact-analyzer** | Trace ripple effects of changes | Before any non-trivial modification |
| **recursive-decomposer** | Break complex into manageable | Large features, multi-step tasks, overwhelmed by scope |

### Guardianship Skills

| Skill | Purpose | When to Invoke |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **pattern-guardian** | Ensure consistency with codebase | Before writing new code, during review, uncertain how to implement |
| **architectural-compass** | Maintain alignment with vision | Design decisions, choosing approaches, phase uncertainty |
| **verification-loop** | Systematic self-verification | After changes, something feels wrong, before commits |

## The Workflow

### Before Any Significant Work

1. **Invoke `recursive-systems-thinking`** - Establish the cognitive framework
2. **Invoke `deep-context-builder`** - Build understanding before action
3. **Invoke `architectural-compass`** - Verify alignment with project vision

### When Planning Changes

1. **Invoke `change-impact-analyzer`** - Understand ripple effects
2. **Invoke `recursive-decomposer`** - Break down into manageable pieces

### While Implementing

1. **Invoke `pattern-guardian`** - Ensure consistency with existing patterns
2. **Invoke `verification-loop`** - Check work at multiple levels

### After Completion

1. **Invoke `verification-loop`** - Full verification at all levels
2. **Invoke `architectural-compass`** - Confirm alignment is maintained

## Key Concepts

### Recursive Thinking
The same patterns apply at every scale. Decomposition is recursive. Verification is recursive. Understanding is recursive.

### Feedback Loops
Every action creates feedback. Use that feedback to adjust course. Verification informs future implementation.

### Holistic Awareness
Local changes have global effects. Always maintain awareness of the whole while working on parts.

### Pattern Respect
Patterns are accumulated wisdom. Follow them unless there's compelling reason to evolve them.

### Phase Discipline
Know what phase you're in. Don't build future phases prematurely.

## Anti-Patterns These Skills Prevent

| Anti-Pattern | Prevented By |
|--------------|--------------|
| Acting without understanding | `deep-context-builder` |
| Unintended consequences | `change-impact-analyzer` |
| Overwhelming complexity | `recursive-decomposer` |
| Inconsistent code | `pattern-guardian` |
| Architectural drift | `architectural-compass` |
| Unverified assumptions | `verification-loop` |
| Cognitive collapse | `recursive-systems-thinking` |

## The Meta-Pattern

These skills are themselves an application of recursive systems thinking:
- They work at multiple scales
- They create feedback loops
- They are self-similar (each skill applies its own principles)
- They compose into a coherent whole

Use them individually as needed. Use them together for complex work. Let them reinforce each other.
