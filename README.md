# The Orrery

**The Orrery is a GAME where your actual life quests are the content.**

Not a productivity tool with game aesthetics. A real game — with all the nervous-system-engaging properties that entails — where the subject matter is your actual projects and tasks. This is the paradigm inversion that makes it work.

## Required Reading (In Order)

Before implementing or modifying, read these documents in sequence:

1. **Soul Transmission** (`doc/soul-transmission.md`) — Who this is for, what "runs on mythopoetics" means, why TTRPGs feel like home
2. **Keystone v2.0** (`doc/keystone-master-artifact-v2.md`) — The Experience Machine ontology, World-OE architecture, gameplay loops
3. **Implementation Spec** (`doc/orrery-implementation-spec.md`) — Technical patterns that serve the above

**The soul and keystone docs are the spec. The implementation doc is the guide.**

If you find yourself treating the first two as "optional philosophy," you will build the wrong thing.  

## Getting started

This project currently uses the standard Vite React setup with ESLint. To install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
